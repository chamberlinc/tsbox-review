### Review Comments

First, I enjoyed the opportunity to review this code. This is the first code review I have done for rOpenSci, and I hope the comments below are helpful. 

I like the general purpose of this package and agree there is probably a lot of use for a package that allows easy conversion between R object types. The documentation I think is all ok, though I think it could be improved with a little more description of the expected structure of data. I did not have any issues with installation. There was one test that failed on my machine (see details in the index.nb.html file in the linked repo, <https://github.com/chamberlinc/tsbox-review>). The code snippets in the three vignettes all worked on my machine.

I will preface my comments by saying I am not an experienced user of data.tables, so following the code was a little tricky for me. I usually work with timeseries as data frames, and I was having trouble following the code and figuring out which columns were being assigned as data, timestamps, or identifiers. This caused a few issues when I had data frames of multiple concurrent timeseries and was getting error messages indicating that the ordering of the columns somehow may have mattered. When working with data frames that only had one timeseries, the functions all worked simply and, it seemed, as intended.

I was mostly experimenting with the `ts_plot()`, `ts_long()`, and `ts_xts()` functions. `ts_xts()` produced an error while working with the data frame that had multiple timeseries. Following the prompting, I tried using `ts_long()`, however this also produced an error that I did not understand, because it seemed to be accessing columns that I did not intend. I didn't see any way to input the correct column names to the function. Once I manually pivoted the data frame using `pivot_longer()` though, I was able to use `ts_xts()` and it performed everything correctly I believe. `ts_plot()` produced error messages that it might have mattered how the columns were organized, and that would have been helpful to know. I was not able to get this function to work for several formats of data frame data, even when following the suggested prompts in the error messages.

The code I used to access data and experiment is provided as well at the linked repo. I hope this is helpful!
