### session info


```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo()
```


```{r pkg_dir, echo = F}
pkg_dir <- "C:/Users/Cathy/Documents/PeerReviewing/tsbox/tsbox"
```

## Test installation

### test local `tsbox` install:

```{r test-local}
try(install(pkg_dir, dependencies = T, build_vignettes = T))
```

```{r github-rm}
remove.packages("tsbox")
```
#### **comments:**

> Local install went without a hitch when I was not knitting the document - no errors or warnings. Errors and warnings that occur while knitting did not happen when just working through the document.

***

### test install of `tsbox` from GitHub with:

```{r test-github}
devtools::install_github("christophsax/tsbox", dependencies = T, build_vignettes = T)
```

#### **comments:**

> Github install seemed to work correctly.

## Check package integrity

### run checks on `tsbox` source:

```{r check-checks}
try(devtools::check(pkg_dir))
```
#### **comments:**

> First time run, this produced error `Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called 'srr'`. After installing `srr` package, 1 error and 1 warning were produced. and one test was skipped. Additionally, one check gave a warning: 'qpdf' is needed for checks on size reduction of PDFs. I have qpdf installed on my machine. Below is the printout:

### run tests on `tsbox` source:

```{r check-tests}
devtools::test(pkg_dir)
```
#### **comments:**

> Again, there was one fail, one warning, and one skipped test. The warning was from ts_first_of_period, due to the timeseries existing of all NAs. The error was also for ts_first_of_period, that 'result would be too long a vector'. The skipped test was for tsibble back-conversion because it appears as an empty test.

### check `tsbox` for goodpractice:

```{r test-goodpractice}
goodpractice::gp(pkg_dir)
```
#### **comments:**

> Returned 174 instances of lines greater than 80 characters. A quick scan of a few of these files indicates this is regularly on the lines that begin with  `@srrstats` .

***

## Check package metadata files

### inspect

- #### [README](https://github.com/christophsax/tsbox)
- #### [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/christophsax/tsbox/blob/master/DESCRIPTION)
- #### [NAMESPACE](https://github.com/christophsax/tsbox/blob/master/NAMESPACE)

### spell check

```{r spell-check}
devtools::spell_check(pkg_dir)
```

#### **comments:**

> Metadata files look ok to me. I think the ReadMe file does a good job of demonstrating the package's capabilities without being overwhelming in detail.

***

## Check documentation

online documentation: **<https://www.tsbox.help>**

* Is the [documentation](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/building.html#documentation) (installation instructions/vignettes/examples/demos) clear and sufficient?

### test `tsbox` function help files:

```{r test-help}
help(package = "tsbox")
```

#### **comments:**

> URL 'help/library/tsbox/html/00Index.html' not found.
The documentation at the link provided gives a good range of demonstrations and examples. I think it is sufficient. 

***

### test `tsbox` vignettes:

```{r test-vignettes}
vignette(package = "tsbox")
```

#### **comments:**

> no vignettes found

***

## Test functionality:

- Are there **user interface improvements** that could be made?
- Are there **performance improvements** that could be made?

```{r free-style}
library("tsbox")
```

```{r parse-functions}
exports <-ls("package:tsbox")
exports
```

<!-- experiment with package functions -->

```{r exp-chunk}
source("./tsbox-review_Chamberlin_codeexperiments.R")

```

#### **comments:**

> I'm impressed that the commands are quite simple and work well for simple timeseries. When using a timeseries data frame of one variable everything worked very well. Trying to convert a data frame of several variables seemed to be more difficult though, and it wasn't clear to me that it is possible to specify which column in the data frame I want to convert. After prompting by messages in ts_xts that there were more than one column detected, I tried converting the data using ts_long(), however it seemed to be trying to pivot some of the identifier columns which were not numeric and gave an error. Once I pivoted the dataframe using pivot_longer, I was able to plot, convert, and scale the data.

> I'm not sure I understand how the ts_plot function is supposed to work - I provided data frames with both POSIXct and character formatting for date/times and got different errors for each.

> For the character timestamps: 
`[time]: 'DateTime' [value]: 'Value' 
Error in colnamesInt(x, neworder, check_dups = FALSE) : 
  argument specifying columns specify non existing column(s): cols[3]='Value'`
  
> For the POSIXct timestamps:
`[time]: 'dateTime' [value]: 'X_00060_00000' 
Error in setnames(x, c(cid, ctime, cvalue), c("id", "time", "value")) : 
  Items of 'old' not found in column names: [X_00060_00000]. Consider skip_absent=TRUE.`
  
> When including skip_absent=TRUE:
`Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : ts_boxable(x) is not TRUE` 


***

## Inspect code:

- Does the package **comply with the [ROpenSci packaging guide](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/building.html)**?
    * good [function & variable naming?](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/building.html#function-and-argument-naming)
    * good [dependency management](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/building.html#package-dependencies)?
- Are there **improvements** that could be made to the [**code style?**](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/building.html#code-style)
- Is there **code duplication** in the package that should be reduced?

```{r inspect-code}
pkgreviewr::pkgreview_print_source("tsbox")
```
**\* might not be suitable for large packages with many exported functions**


<br>
<br>

#### **comments:**

> The function namings are intuitive. Dependecies seem to be well handled.


## Review test suite:

See guidance on [testing](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/building.html#testing) for further details.

```{r pkg_coverage}
try(covr::package_coverage(pkg_dir))
